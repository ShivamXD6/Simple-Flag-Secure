## ‚ùî Why this module? when there's already Disable Flag Secure by MehediHJOy.

- üíæ **Small in Size**: MehediHJoy (Disable Flag Secure) is too bloated with many useless functions (for purpose of the module) and binaries. It is minimal and faster.

- ‚≠ê **Supports KSU and APatch**: As the Disable Flag Secure doesn't have any updates since 2022, so this doesn't support KSU or APatch. But Simple Flag Secure Does :)

- üñ•Ô∏è **Using Only Modified Dex**: Flashing Disable Flag Secure in Magisk may sometimes give issues (like for me on android 14) power button stop working. This module solves this by only adding Modified Dex Files, Keeping rest untouch. 

- üí¨ **Codes Readability**: If you open the zip file of Disable Flag Secure it's most likely that you will not understand the codes. Simple Flag Secure have improved code readability by comments and less lines of codes (300 vs 2000)

- üîÑ **Backup Services Jar**: Normally if you remove and flash Disable Flag Secure, you need to wait again 2-3 min (depends on RAM and Processor). In Simple version it creates a backup so removing and flashing this again will take less time then before. 

> [!NOTE]
> You can remove the backup if you want by deleting this directory /data/#SFS
